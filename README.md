# Rotate-a-Linked-List

## Difficulty: Medium

Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to rotate the left shift of the linked list by k nodes, where k is a given positive integer smaller than or equal to the length of the linked list.

Examples:

Input: linkedlist: 2->4->7->8->9 , k = 3
Output: 8->9->2->4->7
Explanation:
Rotate 1: 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2
Rotate 2: 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 4
Rotate 3: 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 4 -> 7

Input: linkedlist: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8 , k = 4
Output: 5->6->7->8->1->2->3->4

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
